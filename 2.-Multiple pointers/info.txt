Multiple pointers

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index
or position and move towards the beginning,
end or middle based on a certain condition

Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well 


any structure:
[-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,5]
"alksjdalksjdlkasjdlks"

a pointer is just a variable 
we use two or more pointers
